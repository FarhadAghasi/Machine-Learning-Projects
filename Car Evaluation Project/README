# Car Evaluation Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of a car using various features such as **buying price**, **maintenance cost**, **number of doors**, **number of persons**, **lug boot size**, **safety**, and more. The dataset used in this project is from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

This project covers the following machine learning tasks:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Transforming categorical features into numerical values.
2. **Feature Analysis**: Performing descriptive statistics and visualizing feature distributions using box plots.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing data dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for visualization and performance improvements.
4. **Modeling**: Building machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier**.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using accuracy and classification metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Car Evaluation** dataset, which contains various attributes of cars, such as:
- **buying**: Buying price of the car (categorical).
- **maint**: Maintenance cost of the car (categorical).
- **doors**: Number of doors in the car (categorical).
- **persons**: Number of persons the car can accommodate (categorical).
- **lug_boot**: Size of the car's luggage boot (categorical).
- **safety**: Safety rating of the car (categorical).
- **class**: Class of the car (target variable: 4 classes: `unacc`, `acc`, `good`, `vgood`).

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have **Python** and the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
